If you find me late this mornin'
Could be the night went on too long
And if my sleep was tossed and broken
Must not have slept where I belong

Ah...

And when the next day's sun is rising
And reason substitutes for pain
I will finally find my way home
To start to live my life again

Ah...
Live my life again
Ah...
Live my life again
Ah...
Live my life again
Ah...
Live my life again
Ah...
Live my life again
Ah...
Live my life again
Ah...
Live my life again
Ah...
Live my life again
