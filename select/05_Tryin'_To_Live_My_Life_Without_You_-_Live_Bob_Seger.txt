All right, you guys feel funky tonight?
Ah yeah, ooh
Ah yeah
This is an old Memphis song, old Memphis song
Say, I used to smoke five packs of cigarettes a day
It was the hardest thing to put them away
I drank four or five bottles of wine
I kept a glass in my hand all the time
Breakin' those habits
Was hard to do
But nothin' compared to the changes
That you put me through
Tryin' to live my life without you babe
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do
Tryin' to forget the love we once shared, yeah
It's the hardest burden I'll ever bear
All right, I said
I had the worst reputation in town
For chasing all the women around
I thought changin' my way of living was hard to do
But it's nothin' compared to the changes
That you put me through
I've done everything I tried to do
But it's gonna take a miracle to get me over you
Tryin' to live my life without you babe
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do
Tryin' to forget the love we once shared, yeah
It's the hardest burden I'll ever bear
Silver bullet!
Ooh, yeah
Tryin' to live my life without you babe
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do
Tryin' to forget the love we shared
It's the hardest burden I'll ever bear
Listen
Tryin' to live my life without you babe
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do
Tryin' to forget the love we shared
It's the hardest burden I'll ever bear
Hit me, babe
Oooh, yeah
Tryin' to live my life without you babe
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do
Tryin' to forget the love we shared
It's the hardest burden I'll ever bear
All right
Ooh, yeah
