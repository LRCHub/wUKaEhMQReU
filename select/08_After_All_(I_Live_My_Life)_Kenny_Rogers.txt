Always think about the days gone by
When my childhood eyes saw only hills & sky
But I'm not the simple minded boy I used to be
No I learned to picture life in it's reality

I found after all the searching life was only what I made it
After all the searching for new games to play
I found after all the searching life was only what I made it
After all the searching for a new game to play

I live my life away

Saw a dragon shake cathedral walls
While a steeple bell rang out in anguish calls
And I turned my eyes to see a bird fly over head
And I dreamt it's wings of freedom could be mine instead

I found after all the dreaming life was only what I made it
After all the dreaming for new games to play
I found after all the dreaming life was only what I made it
After all the dreaming of new games to play
I drink my life away

Even after all the searching life was only what I made it
After all the searching for a new game to play
After all the searching life was only how you take it
After all the searching for a new game to play

I live my life away
Live it all
Live it all
Oh no no
